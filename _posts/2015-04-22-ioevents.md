#### Fluids (IOEvents, Additives, Totalbalevents)

In version 2.6, patient input/output (IO) data is recorded in the
```ioevents```, ```d_ioitems```, ```deliveries```, ```totalbalevents``` and ```additives``` tables.

In version 3.0, we retired the DELIVERIES table since the data contained
in this table (RATE, RATEUOM etc.) are included in the ```IOEVENTS``` table.
As mentioned earlier, the ```D_IOITEMS``` table has been merged into the
```D_ITEMS``` table.

**Please note that the ITEMIDs for IO or ADDITIVES ITEMS have been
shifted up by 40001 to avoid overlapping with ITEMIDs for the CHART
ITEMS (refer to table 3).**

As with the ```MEDEVENTS``` table, the ```IOEVENTS``` and ```ADDITIVES``` tables in v3.0 have some new columns like ‘```ORDERID```’, a foreign key referring to the ```ORDERENTRY``` table. Users can get more detailed medical order-related information from the ```ORDERENTRY``` table.

As in the ```MEDEVENTS``` table, the new IO data includes ‘```STARTTIME```’ and
‘```ENDTIME```’, making calculations of total INPUT/OUTPUT volumes much
easier.

Another change to these tables is that the ‘LABEL’ of ```ITEMID``` is included
in the table; users can do word-based searches right on the events
table, no need to join with the ```D_ITEMS``` table first.
