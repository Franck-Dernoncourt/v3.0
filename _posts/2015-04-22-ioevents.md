## ```IOEVENTS``` table

In version 2.6, patient input/output (IO) data is recorded in the
```IOEVENTS```, ```D_IOITEMS```, ```DELIVERIES```, ```TOTALBALEVENTS``` and ```ADDITIVES``` tables.

In version 3.0, we retired the DELIVERIES table since the data contained
in this table (RATE, RATEUOM etc.) are included in the ```IOEVENTS``` table.
As mentioned earlier, the ```D_IOITEMS``` table has been merged into the
```D_ITEMS``` table.

**Please note that the ITEMIDs for IO and ADDITIVES ITEMS have been
shifted up by 40001 to avoid overlapping with ITEMIDs for the CHART
ITEMS (refer to table 3).**

The ```IOEVENTS``` table has new columns, including ‘```ORDERID```’, a foreign key referring to the ```ORDERENTRY``` table. Users can get more detailed medical order-related information from the ```ORDERENTRY``` table. The new IO data includes ```STARTTIME``` and ```ENDTIME```, making calculations of total INPUT/OUTPUT volumes more straightforward.

Another change to these tables is that the ‘LABEL’ of ```ITEMID``` is included
in the table; users can do word-based searches right on the events
table, no need to join with the ```D_ITEMS``` table first.
