### Overview

For the first time MIMIC-II contains data from two different source databases (CareVue and MetaVision). This new version of MIMIC-II maps and combines data from MIMIC2V26 (45 tables) and MetaVision (506 tables), as well as additional data sets from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (23 tables) and Social Security datasets (2 tables).

Mapping and combining data from the two systems was challenging due to large differences between the two systems and limited availability of documentation. As a result of the mapping process it was necessary to make numerous changes to the database structure, so V3.0 is significantly different from earlier (V2.x) versions. 

We are aware that further work is needed to clean, optimise, and develop the database and we welcome your assistance in doing this. Please share observations, bugs, and suggestions for improvement via the issue tracker [https://github.com/mimic2/v3.0/issues](https://github.com/mimic2/v3.0/issues).
