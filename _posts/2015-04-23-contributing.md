#### How to contribute

Providing support for the MIMIC-II database is an ongoing process. Our resources are limited, so please help us to update and improve documentation.

These guidelines are hosted on GitHub, making it straightforward for you to raise issues and suggest changes.

#### Raising an issue

If you notice something that could be improved, such as:

- a factual error in the guidelines;
- a common question that should be documented;

...then please raise an issue on Github. To raise an issue, [open the issue tracker](https://github.com/mimic2/v3.0/issues), select "New issue", and then add a description (along with a suggested solution, if possible).

#### Updating the guidelines

We encourage you to directly contribute to the guidelines. To do this, please:

- fork [the repository](https://github.com/mimic2/v3.0)
- edit the documentation as appropriate
- submit a pull request
