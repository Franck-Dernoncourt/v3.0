## Sharing code

<!-- Sharing code supports:

: validation and improvement of methods
: better use of resources. No need to rewrite existing code.
: reuse in education

Should credit authors of code where possible, for example through an acknowledgement or, where appropriate, co-authorship.

here we should describe how to share, and what everything means, e.g.
what licenses
how to share
etc
-->
