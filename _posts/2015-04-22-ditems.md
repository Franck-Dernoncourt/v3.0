#### ```D_ITEMS``` table

In version 2.6, the ```ITEMID``` and labels (descriptions) for different
events tables (such as ```CHARTEVENTS```, ```MEDEVENTS```, ```IOEVENTS```, ```LABEVENTS```) are stored in separate tables; the ranges of the ```ITEMID```s in these tables are listed in Table 2.

Table name | Range of ```ITEMID```
--- | ---
```D_Chartitems``` | 1 - 20009
```D_Meditems``` | 1 – 405
```D_IOitems``` | -1 - 6807
```D_Labitems``` | 50001 - 50735
```D_Codeditems``` | 60001 - 101885
```D_Demographicitems``` | 200001 - 200088

*Table: The ITEMS tables in version 2.6*

In version 3.0, we combined all D\_...ITEMS tables from v2.6 and the
MetaVision PARAMETERS (ITEMS) to form the new ```D_ITEMS``` table.

When we attempted to merge the Metavision data with MIMIC2V26 data, one
of the big challenges was to properly map and merge the D\_...ITEMS
table. Since Metavision data does not separate ```ITEMID```s into the same
categories (Med, IO, Coded, Lab, Chart etc.) and their names can be
totally different, it is nearly impossible to map them directly to the
six different D\_...ITEMS tables and the ```ITEMID```s in MIMIC2V26. To solve
the problem, we took the approach of combining all D\_...ITEMS tables in
v2.6 and the ```PARAMETERS``` Table in MetaVision, thus forming the new
```D_ITEMS``` table.

***Please note that, in version 2.6 and earlier versions of MIMIC2
database, one specific ITEM can have more than one ```ITEMID```. This is still
the case in version 3.0; users will have to add the MetaVision ```ITEMID``` to
the list of ITEMIDs by running a name (or word)-based search in the
```D_ITEMS``` table.***

Since we needed to merge all the D\_...ITEMS tables into one table in
version 3.0, we had to make sure different types of ```ITEMID```s (from
different D\_...ITEMS tables in version 2.6) are within their own
numeric range (no overlapping). Therefore, two types of ```ITEMID```s (MED and
IO) from version 2.6 had to be shifted to a higher range of integers to
avoid overlap with ```ITEMID```s from ```D_Chartitems``` (see Table 2).

The ‘```ORIGIN```’ column added to the new ```D_ITEMS``` table indicates the source table of the data (```ITEMID```s). The following table lists the ORIGINs and ```ITEMID``` ranges in version 3.0.

v3.0 Table name | ORIGIN | Range of ITEMID | Difference | Source table in v2.6 database
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
```D_ITEMS``` | CHART | 1 - 20009 | None | ```D_Chartitems``` (v2.6)
 | MED | 30001 – 30405 | + 30000 | ```D_Meditems``` (v.2.6)
 | IO | 40000 – 46808 | + 40001 | ```D_IOitems``` (v2.6)
 | LAB | 50800 – 51554 | Re-generated ITEMIDs | ```D_ Labitems``` (v2.6)
 | CODED | 60001 - 101885 | None | ```D_Codeditems``` (v2.6)
 | DEMOGRAPHIC | 200001 - 200088 | none | ```D_Demographicitems``` (v2.6)
 | METAVISION | 220003 - 228647 | +220000 | MetaVision DB

*Table: The ```D_ITEMS``` table in version 3.0 and ranges of ```ITEMID```s*

Since the ```D_ITEMS``` table in v3.0 combined all six of the D\_...ITEMS
tables in v2.6 and we kept all related columns, the ```D_ITEMS``` table does
have more columns than any of its source tables. The following table
lists the column names, data types and source tables of all columns in
```MIMIC2V30.D_ITEMS``` table.

Column name | Data type | New column | Source tables/Database 
--- | --- | --- | ---
```ITEMID``` | NUMBER(7) | N | ```D_Chartitems```, ```D_Meditems```, ```D_IOitems```, ```D_Codeditems```, ```D_Labitems```, ```D_Demographicitems``` and METAVISION Database
```LABEL``` | VARCHAR2(100) | N | ```D_Chartitems```, ```D_Meditems```, ```D_IOitems```, ```D_Codeditems```, ```D_Demographicitems``` and METAVISION Database
```ABBREVIATION``` | VARCHAR2(50) | Y | METAVISION Database
```ORIGIN``` | VARCHAR2(12) | Y | The origin of the ```ITEMID``` (v2.6 or Metavision)
```CODE``` | VARCHAR2(10) | N | ```D_Codeditems```
```CATEGORY``` | VARCHAR2(50) | N | ```D_Chartitems```, ```D_IOitems```, ```D_Codeditems```, ```D_Labitems```, ```D_Demographicitems``` and METAVISION
```UNITID``` | NUMBER(5) | Y | METAVISION Database
```UNITNAME``` | VARCHAR2(50) | Y | METAVISION Database
```TYPE``` | VARCHAR2(40) | N | D\_Codeditems and METAVISION
```DESCRIPTION``` | VARCHAR2(150) | N | ```D_Chartitems```, ```D_Codeditems```
```LOWNORMALVALUE``` | FLOAT(126) | Y | METAVISION Database
```HIGHNORMALVALUE``` | FLOAT(126) | Y | METAVISION Database
```ALLERGYACTION``` | NUMBER(3) | Y | METAVISION Database
```LOINC_CODE``` | Varchar2(7) | N | Lab data from BIDMC
```LOINC_DESCRIPTION``` | Varchar2(100) | N | Lab data from BIDMC
```OLD_LABITEMID``` | NUMBER(7) | Y | ```D_Labitems```
```OLD_TEST_NAME``` | VARCHAR2(50) | Y | ```D_Labitems```
