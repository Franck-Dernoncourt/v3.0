# Towards an open community

MIMIC II is an openly available ICU database - it is revolutionary in this regard, and a great resource to researchers around the world. Now, we want to extend this concept to beyond just the database. While the people behind MIMIC have put their very best effort into ensuring that the database is usable to all researchers, we have unfortunately only finite resources to tackle the infinite number of research questions. It is for this reason that we have begun to move toward building a community of researchers who actively seek to learn more about the database and contribute their knowledge to the betterment of all others. The github repository used to store this documentation is an example of this - here we will continue to post both information which researchers may find useful and code to facilitate their use of the database.

# Sharing code

We strongly encourage any researcher to share any code they create which would add value to the community as a whole. We have chosen GitHub as our platform of choice, and encourage others to create and share repositories based on their work as well.

Read more about GitHub on their [homepage](https://github.com/).
