#### ```ICD9``` table

The ```ICD9``` table is an important table for users to check patient
diagnoses. The structure of this table did not change in the new
version.

But for the first time, the admission diagnosis (```adm_diagnosis```)
information is now available in the ```ADMISSIONS``` table in v3.0. (This
diagnosis is assigned by the admitting office at the moment of admission
based on input from the admitting physician. It may be modified after
the patient is treated in the hospital.)
