# User guide for the MIMIC-II database

MIMIC-II is a widely-accessible database that is intended to support research into critical care, for the benefit of patients. 

This repository contains the code used to create the MIMIC-II guidelines available at: http://mimic2.github.io/v3.0/

## Contributing

We encourage the research community to help us develop and improve MIMIC-II. For example, we find it helpful to know about challenges that you experience when using MIMIC-II. We'd also like to know about any questions that you have which aren't adequately answered by the documentation.
