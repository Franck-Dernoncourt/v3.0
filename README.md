# User guide for the MIMIC-II database

MIMIC-II is a widely-accessible database that is intended to support research into critical care, for the benefit of patients. 

This repository contains the code used to create the MIMIC-II guidelines available at: http://mimic2.github.io/v3.0/

## Contributing

We encourage the research community to help us develop and improve MIMIC-II. For example, we find it helpful to know about challenges that you experience when using the database. We'd also like to know about any questions that you have which aren't adequately answered by the documentation.
