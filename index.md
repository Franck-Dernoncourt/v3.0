## MIMIC-II research database (v3.0)

The MIMIC-II research database (Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care) is notable for three factors: 

- it is publicly and freely available; 
- it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients; 
- and it contains high temporal resolution data including lab results, electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and waveforms. 

The database supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development.

This website is intended to help researchers to set up and use version 3.0 of the MIMIC-II database. Please [help us](bac/contributing.html) to develop and improve the documentation.
